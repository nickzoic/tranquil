 TRANQUIL
==========

Tranquil is a protocol framework which helps define the way that a client
connects to a server.  It is designed to be very simple and very extensible.

In terms of complexity, it fits somewhere between
`REST <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer>`_
and `SOAPjr <http://www.soapjr.org/>`_.
